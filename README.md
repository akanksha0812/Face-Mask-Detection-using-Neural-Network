# Face-Mask-Detection-using-Neural-Network

Face mask detection is a computer vision task where a model is trained to identify whether individuals in images or video streams are wearing face masks. Using machine learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model first recognizes faces in the frame using face detection algorithms. Then, it focuses on relevant areas, determining whether a mask covers each face. The system learns from a database of labeled images that contain people with and without masks. In real-time application, it alerts when someone is not wearing a mask, assisting in enforcing mask-wearing rules in public spaces during health crises like COVID-19.
